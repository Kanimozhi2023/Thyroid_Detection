#Thyroid Detection Project
This project leverages machine learning to detect thyroid disorders based on clinical and laboratory data. It uses a Random Forest model for predictions and provides an interactive interface built with Streamlit for easy use. The model is tracked and managed using MLflow.

Features
Data Processing: Preprocessing and cleaning of clinical and laboratory data.

Model Training: Random Forest model trained and optimized for classification tasks.

Model Management: MLflow is used for tracking experiments and managing model versions.

Interactive Web App: Streamlit application for user interaction, allowing predictions from JSON/Excel input.

Technology Stack
Python: Core programming language.
Machine Learning: Random Forest (scikit-learn).
Streamlit: For building the web application.
MLflow: Model tracking and management.
pandas: Data manipulation.
joblib/pickle: Model serialization for deployment.
